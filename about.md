# About this Page 关于本网页

Few days ago, I went through a very famous blogging framework (which is WordPress). After several times of trying to set it up and using it, I found that it is quite hard to use, and also the server gone unstable a lot of times.

So, I decided to try this VitePress framework, which is very new for me. I realized that this framework is quite easy to get started than WordPress, and its editor is more flexible. 

In this site, I will try to include anything about competitive programming (or DSA) for future reference.
