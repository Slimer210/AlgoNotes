# Getting Started

::: info
All document present here will be using either English or Simplified Chinese, based on my personal preferences. I will try to entirely using English except some special situation.

# New to Competitive Programming?

This document will be writing some easy study notes for data structures & algorithms. In case anything that is too hard to understand, you can try to ask ChatGPT for help (since I'm also asking for help from ChatGPT).

Don't worry about using too much AI will affect your programming experience. AI is a great tool for you to understand something, it will aid you a lot if you're able to understand how to use it.

As a student who experience competitive programming before, I can confirm that learning competitive programming is an **arduous** journey for everyone, especially for those who not very good in basic programming.

But always remember, **Very good at programming NOT means you're good at competitive programming**. Competitive programming is about your logical thinking, and your programming skills are subjective.

Hope you have a good luck and enjoy competitive!

# My roadmap

I recommended to learn **C++** instead of C or Java as it have better syntax & library to use. It's **strongly recommended** to understand basic first before continuing.

After that, you can try to study some **STL library** stuff which will aid you during competition.

Always keep yourself with a habit that always practice programming every day. You can choose to practice programming at:

- Codechef (recommended for beginners)
- Codeforces (recommended for intermediates)
- UVa (recommended for experts, if you dare)

And at last, you're strongly recommended to study **Data Structures and Algorithms (aka. DSA)** if you have adequate skills and time.


# Or maybe...I just here to find the school class notes

Sure. No problem.
